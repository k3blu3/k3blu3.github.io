	Land doesn't vote, right? 
	</p>

	<p>
	What about the natural colors of the land, though? To some degree, they are related to how your block, neighborhood and city you live in votes. 
	</p>

	<p>
	To reveal this pattern, we processed 2016/2017 data from the <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/">National Agricultural Imagery Program</a> and indexed it with election results from the 2016 presidential election. The end result of this processing was a searchable set of image tiles, each half a kilometer across, that covered nearly every square meter of the continental United States.

	<p>
	The margin of victory, ranging from -100 (heavily democratic) to 100 (heavily republican) was binned with a width of 10. For every margin bin, we created an index of the number of times each unique color appeared. Finally, for every bin, we kept the 100,000 most frequently occuring colors and sorted them by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance">luminance</a>.

	The figure at the top is the visualization that results from this processing over the entire continental United States. It reveals the true natural colors of America's political spectrum.

	<p>
	We also did this processing for individual states, as well as with the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/national-land-cover-database?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects">National Land Cover Database</a>.
