	I'm a data scientist and engineer with a background in digital signal processing, machine learning and applied math. I'm fascinated by how much we can understand about our changing planet from earth observation data and satellite imagery. I'm working on building analysis tools to make these datasets and corresponding insights accessible to everyone.
